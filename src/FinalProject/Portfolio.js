            question: "Unraveling the Quest",
            answer: "Our group tackled the challenge question by brainstorming unique ideas to gain different perspectives. Among the ideas we had were… We coordinated with our project sponsor Murwan Khogali Ali, a youth outreach worker at Healing as one. He provided us with valuable insights that guided our quest for a solution to the given challenge. Through his many connections we were able to establish contacts with multiple youth organizations and high schools. We initiated contact with multiple high schools and community centres to find potential collaborators. We finally landed 2 event sponsors at Tommy Douglas and Regent Park? To prepare for the workshop we coordinated with the school staff to set up equipment and event supplies to provide students with a platform to engage in entrepreneurial creativity.The Event at Tommy Douglas was a 2 day event with the first day for generating creative and unique business solutions to any of the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). On the second day the students had the opportunity to pitch their business solution to an audience and a chance to win prizes such as… Alongside our development of a hands-on experiential based workshop we also  developed a resource hub website so that we could leverage the skills of our team members in Computer Science. The website developed was a user-centric, responsive and interactive website that will serve as an excellent marketing and outreach tool to communicate our mission statement.",

            question: "Crafting the Solution",
            answer: "This challenge question revolves around developing training for future leaders in order to be capable of addressing community issues across both for-profit and not-for-profit sectors, while also encouraging entrepreneurship and creating their own business opportunities.

            question: "Trials and Triumphs",
            answer: "The journey of the Tommy Douglas Secondary School workshop, aimed at empowering youth through the creation of business proposals addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), was both challenging and enlightening. This project not only faced significant hurdles but also experienced pivotal 'A-ha' moments that guided its direction and execution. Below is a detailed analysis of the project journey, encapsulating what worked, what didn't, encountered limitations, and the breakthrough moments. The project's timeline brought challenges, primarily due to the constant development of our idea. idea development process. Initial concepts ranged from hosting a booth at an existing event to creating a website and a resource hub before settling on the workshop format. Each pivot required reevaluation and additional planning, significantly impacting the project timeline. Networking and logistical arrangements presented considerable obstacles. Attempts to secure a venue through the Toronto District School Board encountered delays and unresponsive contacts, highlighting the difficulty of navigating through these organizations. It wasn't until reaching out to the former high school of four team members that the project found a successful venue at Tommy Douglas Secondary School. Time constraints, compounded by a limited budget, further restricted the project's scope and ambition. The workshop had to strike a delicate balance between being informative and stimulating, ensuring that the material was neither overly simplistic nor intimidatingly complex. This required careful planning and adaptability in teaching methods to cater to a broad audience effectively. A significant breakthrough came from a referral by the executive officer of Schulich School of Business. This connection provided valuable insights from an individual with firsthand experience in negotiating with schools and school boards. Although the timing did not align for the intended workshop location, the encounter offered invaluable knowledge and guidance for future endeavors. The overwhelming positive feedback from the Tommy Douglas Secondary School workshop served as a motivational boost. It affirmed the workshop's impact and potential, setting a positive precedent for subsequent workshops, including the planned event in Regent Park. The workshop concept proved to be highly effective. It resonated with students, many of whom expressed an interest in starting their own businesses. The workshop's format, which allowed for creative freedom in presenting business proposals, facilitated active engagement and learning. The diverse range of presentation mediums, from slideshows to clay sculptures, emphasized the success of this flexible approach. The workshop's duration was a notable concern. Originally envisioned as a 3-hour event, time constraints necessitated a reduction to 1.5 hours. This limited timeframe proved challenging for participants tasked with developing comprehensive business plans, highlighting a gap between the workshop's objectives and the practical time available to achieve them. The journey of the Tommy Douglas workshop, from its initial idea to its execution, emphasizes the intricate balance between vision and feasibility within project management. Despite the logistical and operational challenges encountered, the project's ability to adapt and respond to feedback played a crucial role in its eventual success. The overwhelmingly positive response from participants not only validated the workshop's impact but also highlighted the potential for such initiatives to inspire and empower youth towards social entrepreneurship and sustainable development. Overall, our path had its challenges, but the rewards of engaging and empowering students in meaningful ways are invaluable.",

            question: "Legacy of Tomorrow",
            answer: "Our group had a goal of helping future leaders thrive, and teach them how to create opportunities for themselves in the future. We are hoping that our influence will have taught them skills to sustain themselves, but also the planet as well. This is why our workshops consisted of establishing businesses inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Additionally, we are willing to pass on our NGO to future C4 students if they are interested, which will further continue our legacy. Although we may not be there to directly witness these businesses potentially come to fruition, our hope is to have laid the groundwork for the potential beginning of their journeys. We ensured that we did everything within our power to jumpstart their future careers. Drawing from our own experiences as students, we shared insights and advice to kickstart their future careers. Furthermore, we worked with Healing As One to award certificates to help bolster each participant’s professional profile. Finally, we taught them about the intricacies of building a sustainable, and environmentally friendly business. Even though we will not be conducting any more workshops in the future, we know that we left behind a legacy through the knowledge, tools, and insights we offered to help empower students and unlock the leadership potential we know they possess.",
